- Game Description:

- Code Structue:

- Technology used:
    HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
    JavaScript, PHP
    Github

- Issues/Problems encountered:
    We had some issues with github a couple of times, but we were able to fix the problem and merge everything during the group meetings.
    During the sprint #2: 
    We have been working on implementing the background music and sound effect, and volume slider to control the volume. 
    But it is taking more time than we expected due to some js variable issues. We will be able to figure it out during next sprint.
    During the sprint #3: 
    We focused on debugging/testing our game. 
    We actually spent a lot of time on fixing unexpected errors,
    so there were some tasks that we couldn't complete.
    But we achieve our main goals by prioritizing the most important tasks. 
    Scrum spreadsheet was very helpful when prioritizing tasks and dividing them.
