- Team info:
    Group 2
    (Takito Cabrera, Jei Yang, Kuanysh Boranbayev, Jonathan Huang, Colt King)

- Game Description:
	LogiColor is a brain game that focus on multiprocessing and arithmatic logic on numbers, colors and shapes. As the name LogiColor implies, it 
	will mainly consist of a color aspect in each of the problem shown. In the game, there will be tutorial and a color wheel for players who are
	new to the combination of the primary colors and secondary colors. The game offers two mode being marathon mode and speed mode. Marathon limits
	the player with only three lives and the score accumulated are depending on how fast the player solves the problem. The other mode, speed mode,
	is more like a survival where the player has to solve the problem under pressure inorder to progress or climb the ladder.

- Code Structue:
    1) Javascript files, Images, Stylesheets and Sounds were stored in their respective folder.
    2) Most of the apps html files were turned to .php extensions and stored in the main Repo folder. We used PHP to break the
    code into manageable pieces that could be used across multiple files.
    3) The names used for most of our files attempt to describe the main functions contained within the file.

- Technology used:
    HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
    JavaScript, PHP
    Github, MySQL

- Issues/Problems encountered:
    We had some issues with github a couple of times, but we were able to fix the problem and merge everything during the group meetings.
    During the sprint #2: 
    We have been working on implementing the background music and sound effect, and volume slider to control the volume.
    But it is taking more time than we expected due to some js variable issues. We will be able to figure it out during next sprint.
    During the sprint #3: 
    We focused on debugging/testing our game. 
    We actually spent a lot of time on fixing unexpected errors,
    so there were some tasks that we couldn't complete.
    But we achieve our main goals by prioritizing the most important tasks. 
    Scrum spreadsheet was very helpful when prioritizing tasks and dividing them.
