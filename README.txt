Logicolor - Colour / Arithmetic Game (Memory/Speed)
Team info:
    Group 2
    (Takito Cabrera, Jei Yang, Kuanysh Boranbayev, Jonathan Huang, Colt King)

Technology used:
    HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript, PHP
    Github

Issues/Problems encountered:
We had some issues with github, the day before submission but we were able to fix the problem and merge everything.
During the sprint #2, we have been working on implementing the background music and sound effect, and volume slider to control the volume. But it is taking more time than we expected due to some js variable issues. We will be able to figure it out during next sprint.

User Guide (1-page minimum, no page limitation), with screenshots, of how to run/test the game.
Our database is hosted locally, so the first thing you need to do is import a copy of our database in SQL (We currently use MAMP). The file is included in our zip file and it is called “db.sql”.
Our database default details are found in databasedetails.php. Please change those parameters if your current localhost has a different HOSTNAME, USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD.
1. Start from welcomeTakitoDesign.php.
Log in to start the game
(With the database installed, feel free to create an account. If you don’t want to create an account, you can use our test account: hola3@email.com password: Takito1)

2.  Below is our main page you’ll see after you sign in, welcomeScreenTakitoDesign.html.
The first two buttons are linked to the game - Marathon mode and Speed run mode. Currently we are still working on implementing shapes and patterns into our game play for different levels and difficulties.

The ‘Leaderboard’ button takes you to our leaderboard where you can see your ranking after playing games. ‘Tutorial’ has a short demonstration video on how to play the game. The video will be edited after implementing more difficult level games and with our updated game mode.

 3. Difficulty Screen
You will see this screen when you click ‘Marathon mode’ or ‘Speed mode’ to play the game. Currently we don’t have different levels for the game but this will be updated next week.
